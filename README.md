# Objective 
This game was initially developed for the Dufferin-Peel game design competition, hosted by University of Toronto Mississauga in the 2017-2018 school year. Our team was able to place first for the best 3D game award.

In game, the player is able to collect and purchase items by exploring the 3D open world. Afterwards, to move on, the player must pass through the 2D sidescroller levels by using the items that they've collected in the 3D world.
